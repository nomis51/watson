#### What is a frame?

It's a task or an activity. Basically what you're working on. Usually it's a simple name, like
`cooking` or 'project-abc'. You can also add as many `tags` as you want to describe the `frame`.

For example, if you're cooking a pizza, you could say `watson start cooking pizza`.
The project is `cooking` the tag is `pizza`.

Tags can help you find frames related to specific tasks within a project.
